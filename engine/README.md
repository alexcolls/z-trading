# üöÄ Zorro Trading Engine

## Overview

Zorro is an ecosystem for financial research and algorithmic trading. It is not a 'robot' and not a trading platform, but has some elements of both. Its main purpose is data analysis and algorithmic trading with C or C++ scripts in automated or semi-automated mode. 

Technically it's a front end to a C or C++ compiler and a set of modules for time series analysis, machine learning, optimization, and online broker or data source access. It allows with a few button clicks to edit trading strategy scripts, train machine learning algorithms, optimize and backtest systems with several methods, and trade them live.
